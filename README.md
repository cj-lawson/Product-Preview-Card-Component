## Overview


### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a product preview card component and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My Solution

- Used the challenge as a very rough reference and ended up significantly altering the design and built a solution for a product card featuring a wallet brand. 

- Not part of the challenge, but I Built a color picker feature in React.js that updates/toggles the product image to match the chosen wallet color.

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

First time using Vitejs and seriously enjoyed the experience. Noticeably faster than Create React App and super minimal setup.

This project was a fun way to work on my layout skills with grid and flexbox. Had a weird issue with border radius not working on one half of my flexbox div - Overflow hidden fixed this.
