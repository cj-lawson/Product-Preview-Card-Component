## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a responsive product card that fits to the appropriate screen size
- Toggle between two variants of the same product 

## Solution

- Used the challenge as a very rough reference and ended up significantly altering the design and built a solution for a product card featuring a wallet brand. 

- Not part of the challenge, but I Built a color picker feature in React.js that updates/toggles the product image to match the chosen wallet color. 

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

First time using Vitejs and seriously enjoyed the experience. Noticably faster than Create React App and super minimal setup.

This project was a fun way to work on my layout skills with grid and flexbox. Had a weird issue with border radius not working on one half of my flexbox div - Overflow hidden fixed this.
